    First I am going to picks a random number between min and max (inclusive). and tell you the range.

    You have up to 10 rounds to guess the correct number.
    I will tell you:
    "Higher" if your guess is too low.
    "Lower" if your guess is too high.
    "YOU GOT IT" if your guess is correct.

    The Money Rules:
    The game starts with me owing you $5.
    Every time you guess wrong, the amount that owes you is reduced by $1 (e.g. round 2 I owe you 4 dollars, round 6 you owe me 1 dollar).

    If you guess the number within the 5 first rounds
    You get whatever money is currently owed to you
    Or, you owe me if you are still guessing after round 5
    The game ends when:
    You guess correctly or after 10 rounds without a correct guess â€” you owe me $5.
    Tell the player gAME FINISHED.
